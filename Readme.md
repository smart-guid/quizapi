Architectual Improvements of the Quiz Service

1. Separation of Concerns

    Domain: Pure business logic, no dependencies
   
    Application: Use cases and orchestration
   
    (Data) Infrastructure: Data access and external concerns
   
    API: HTTP concerns and controllers

3. Dependency Flow
    
    API → Application → Domain
   
    Infrastructure → Application → Domain
   
    Domain has no dependencies (Dependency Inversion)

4. Testability

    Each layer can be tested independently
   
    Easy to mock dependencies
   
    Clear boundaries for unit vs integration tests

5. Maintainability

    Changes in one layer don't affect others
   
    Easy to swap implementations
   
    Clear responsibility boundaries

6. Scalability
    
    Can easily add new features without affecting existing code
   
    Can deploy layers separately if needed
   
    Easy to add cross-cutting concerns (logging, caching, ect..)

Optional Enhancements:

  MediatR: For more advanced CQRS with request/response pattern
  
  FluentValidation: For command/query validation
  
  AutoMapper: For DTO mapping
